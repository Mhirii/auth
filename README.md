you can try the api [here](https://auth.ahmedmhiri218.workers.dev/)
I used the generous free tier of [xata](https://xata.io/)

to run locally clone this repo then make sure you have wrangler installed
```
bun install
```

you have to set some env variables in wrangler.toml
```
  XATA_BRANCH
  XATA_API_KEY
  JWT_SECRET
```
setup your xata db then use their cli to setup the project


Swagger doc will be added soon
